Create a site MY-METEO to :
- Show the objectif of the site (HOME)

- Search weather of city by name (CITY)

- Show weather by geolocation (GEOLOCATION)

- Find more informations with other siter (ACTUALITIES)

- Prevent the user for bar URL (404)

- Have a data base to register his program (PREFERENCE) //This page not work//


ROUTING :
- Establish the routing with index.html
- I write two conditions for the page 'home' because in my header.php , it was impossible to find this page when I write nothing between the quote of ahref


APIS :
- API to call current weather data for one location by city name ( http://openweathermap.org/current )

- IP Geolocation API (http://ip-api.com/docs/#response_formats_and_examples)


OTHER TOOLS :
- Use Bootstrap for templates

- Use Github for the versionning (https://github.com/EvaJamen/site-meteo)

- Use Gulp to minimify my css  (This task is not end)

AND MORE :
- Credit author for the icons that I use (http://www.flaticon.com/)
